# vuetify-time-select

An alternative time-picker using dropdowns instead of the MD time "wheel".

**Requires [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)** - built using Vuetify Components

While [Vuetify's TimePicker](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/time-pickers) is an excellent component and conforms to the Material Design Specs, some users may find it confusing or cumbersome (especially on a desktop app). This component is provided as an alternative that still conforms to (other) MD specs and works within the Vuetify ecosystem. 

See a working example here: https://codepen.io/fontzter/pen/GRRMqNa

## Installation

From the root of a Vue project **already using Vuetify**:

```sh
npm i -S vuetify-time-select
```

Or if using yarn

```sh
yarn add vuetify-time-select
```

If you want the component to be registered and available globally, from your main Vue configuration file (frequently `src/main.js`), add the following **before** instantiating Vue for the first time:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VuetifyTimeSelect from 'vuetify-time-select'

Vue.use(VuetifyTimeSelect)
```

Or if you just want to use the `vuetify-time-select` component within another component:

```vue
<script>
  import { VuetifyTimeSelect } from 'vuetify-time-select'
  export default {
    components: {
      VuetifyTimeSelect
    },
    /* ... the rest of your code ... */
  }
</script>
```

## Basic Usage

```vue
<template>
  <vuetify-time-select v-model="time"></vuetify-time-select>
</template>

<script>
  // the import statement and components section is unnecessary
  // if the component was registered globally (see above)
  import { VuetifyTimeSelect } from 'vuetify-time-select'

  export default {
    components: {
      VuetifyTimeSelect
    },
    data: () => ({
      time: '20:30' // specified in HH:MM format
    })
    /* ... the rest of your code ... */
  }
</script>
```
